# Blackfriday_linear_reg_svm_knn

In this project, we are going to predict how much the customers will spend during Black Friday, using various features such as age, gender, marital status. The dataset we are going to use is the Black Friday dataset from Kaggle which contains about 550068 rows and 12 features. The dataset csv are attached here.
We will apply three regression algorithms(i.e. Linear regression.SVM and KNN) on the dataset and try to compare the results of those.
